CHAPEL CHASE

Project Description:
My project's name is Chapel Chase, essentially a spinoff from the commonly
popular game Temple Run. The primary theme of this game is an explorer being chased
by a group of demon monkeys as the explorer embarks on an adventure to seek an 
ancient and valuable treasure from a chapel. During their journey, the explorer will
face obstacles and turns at increasing speeds. The goal of the game is to run as
far as possible before dying.

How to Run Project:
Go to the 'Chapel Chase Code' file, copy code, and paste it in Virtual Studio Code or another source to run code.

NOTE: You need CMU_Graphics installed to successfully run the code. 

Have fun with Chapel Chase!
